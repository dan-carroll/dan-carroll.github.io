Games are a fun way to spend your time. They can be relaxing or exciting, even educational. Some are quite challenging and can be great problem-solving mental exercises. So, however you enjoy your games, creating and playing your own creations can be a great way to learn programming techniques.

Created a new repository, [html-games](https://github.com/dan-carroll/html-games), to have a playground for learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript methods outside of what I would normally encounter designing websites. Plus it should be fun. To explore the results of this endeavor, [visit {{ page.title }}](https://dan-carroll.github.io/html-games/).

I plan on including articles on basic game design, some tutorials, a few game collections for inspiration, and working games with code as examples and to show the results of my work with the game design articles and tutorials I experiment with. Will also have some of my own ideas for games, or at least some that I have borrowed from others and modified to my own liking.

So please visit. Enjoy the site. And see what you can learn and have fun doing with some of this.
