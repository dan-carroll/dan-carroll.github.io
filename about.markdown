Thank you for visiting my GitHub site. I have used [GitHub](https://github.com) for years but only recently on a near daily basis. It is a great place for accessing and learning about the numerous open source sites hosted here. Many of which I use in my own work or have found interest in.

GitHub also has it's [Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/), which is a great place to learn about the many aspects of GitHub and their use as well as many programming languages and the world of open source. I believe this is a great place for new programmers to start. Nothing better than to learn to use the power of Git and learn from the code of others.

GitHub also has a great resource in it's Pages. [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) allows you to showcase your work for each of your repositories as well as a site for yourself and/or your organization. What could be better than free hosting to showcase your work in.

And speaking of showcasing your work, the GitHub Pages are a great place to set up a portfolio of your own. That is something I have thought about for years but never took the time to implement. This page is part of that effort.

Thank you [GitHub Team](https://github.com/about/leadership) for all of your hard work and allowing the rest of us to utilize this system to showcase our work!
