## My Blogs -- and Other Sites

- [Dan Reads](https://dan-carroll.github.io/danreads/)

   > My reading list. And other books I like. Plus books I might recommend. Even thinking about adding kids books since I am the proud Papa (grandpa) of 9.

- [365 Day Graphic Design Challenge](https://dan-carroll.github.io/graphic-design-challenge/)

   > The results of my own personal challenge to learn how, or just do, a new graphic each day for 365 days. Not necessarily all contiguous days as I do tend to become side-tracked at times by other projects.

   > My site for much of my meandering journey in learning, and sharing, my work in the programming language of the moment -- Python.

- [Rather Be Coding](#)
