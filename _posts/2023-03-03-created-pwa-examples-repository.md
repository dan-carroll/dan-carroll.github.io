Created a PWA Examples repository to showcase code and examples of progressive web applications as I learn how these work. For more mature examples of working PWAs, check out [these examples](https://github.com/mdn/pwa-examples) on MDN Web Docs. [MDN Web Docs](https://github.com/mdn) is a great place to go to learn the details of web technologies.

I will be starting off with examples and tutorials created by others. Once I get some experience with PWAs, I have some ideas for projects of my own. So follow along with me as I explore the creation and use of PWAs. This should be fun.

And, of course the first PWA to do is a [Hello World example](https://dan-carroll.github.io/pwa-examples/hello-pwa/). Nothing exciting, but is a good first go with the [code for a PWA](https://github.com/dan-carroll/pwa-examples/tree/main/hello-pwa). For a nice introduction to progressive web apps check out [this article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Tutorials/js13kGames/Introduction) on the MDN web docs site. Follow along with [this tutorial](https://medium.com/james-johnson/a-simple-progressive-web-app-tutorial-f9708e5f2605) by [James Johnson](https://github.com/jamesjohnson280/hello-pwa) to create your first PWA.
