My portfolio page was created as part of a GitHub Learning Lab exercise. The author of the *Communicating Using Markdown* course utilized the Jekyll Hacker template. This template could be termed a bit cheezy but I kind of like it. The old school computer look mixed with a few modern tweaks works for me. Maybe some day I'll change the template to bring this part of the site into line with the main pages.

The main page links to section pages housing different parts of my portfolio. I am still working on getting together items to place into the portfolio, while creating new material as ideas pop up. The more I work on this project, the more ideas I get for other projects. A lot of it just small stuff, but small projects tend to grow over time.

I also like to share interesting items I find on GitHub and the internet at large. Some of what I have added to GitHub are in the way of extended notes. This helps me in keeping my notes and ideas organized into one place. It is also quite possible to make these notes into interactive notebooks of sorts. I'm not done by a longshot, so expect to find updates and new items regularly as I find the time.

Hopefully, some of my visitors here will find items of interest here as well as a bit of fun. Happy coding!
