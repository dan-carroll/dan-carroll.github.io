So I added Google Analytics to my GitHub pages. Now to see how that tracks. It will be interesting to see if there are any visitors here.

If you are interested in doing the same, then check out the tutorial from [Niklas Leopold](https://morotsman.github.io/) as I did. His *[How to add Google Analytics to a blog hosted on Github pages](https://morotsman.github.io/blog,/google/analytics,/jekyll,/github/pages/2020/07/07/add-google-analytics.html)* tutorial was quite easy to follow. Thank you Niklas.
