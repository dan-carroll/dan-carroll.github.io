Another PWA based on the tutorial [Getting Started with Offline First using UpUp](https://www.talater.com/upup/getting-started-with-offline-first.html). See the [TalAter/UpUp GitHub repo](https://github.com/TalAter/UpUp/tree/master/demo/getting-started-with-offline-first-demo). Just go down into demo folder for the tutorial code under “getting-started-with-offline-first-demo”. The tutorial isn’t complete. Had to look at the code on GitHub. And the .min.js.map files weren’t complete so changed to using the non-minimized js files from the src folder in the root of the repo.

[UpUp](https://github.com/TalAter/UpUp) is a javascript library that looks to make content available to users -- always. The idea is to change the narrative from Mobile First to Offline First. Not sure how it is going since the site has not been updated in a while. But the tutorial was worth a go. Definite learning experience plus i had to do a bit of troubleshooting.

A look at my [Lonely Globe Repository](https://github.com/dan-carroll/pwa-examples/tree/main/lonely-globe)
