# dan-carroll.github.io
[Dan Carroll's Github Pages](https://dan-carroll.github.io/)
-------------------------
These pages are the gateway into Dan Carroll's online world. Included are my GitHub activities as well as work on other sites. This site is created and maintained with Jekyll: <https://jekyllrb.com/>.

   > **Note**  
   >   
   > As a reminder, [github.dev](https://github.dev/github/dev) can be used as a lightweight web-based editor that runs entirely in your browser. You can navigate files and source code repositories from GitHub, and make and commit code changes.  
   >   
   > There are two ways to go directly to a VS Code environment in your browser and start coding:  
   > - Press the . key on any repository or pull request.  
   > - Swap `.com` with `.dev` in the URL. For example, this repo https://github.com/github/dev becomes http://github.dev/github/dev.

## My GitHub Projects

   > These may not be original works of mine. Could be forkings of interesting projects I wanted to play around with. Or could be projects created from some of the lessons in the GitHub Lab. This is an attempt to organize things a bit here on GitHub.

- [Collection of Development Books Available to Read Online](https://dan-carroll.github.io/online-development-books/)

   > The title above says it all. Follow this link to the GitHub project itself: [https://github.com/dan-carroll/online-development-books](https://github.com/dan-carroll/online-development-books).

   > Simple PWA is a Progressive Web App template that provides the minimum file structure needed to create a PWA. Not my project (yet). I plan on making it my own. It hasn't been updated in awhile and needs changes. Changes that I plan to implement to fit what I want (need).
