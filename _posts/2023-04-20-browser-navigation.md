I was always looking for navigation examples for new websites and never quite got what I wanted. So I would copy and modify things until I got what I wanted. Keeping track of so many examples was becoming a bit confusing.

So why not put together some examples of my own. Include some tutorials and how-tos along with other examples. Make it easy for me to find and keep track of what I like alongside of some of my own working code. And put it where I could readily find, and access, it.

Looks like GitHub is perfect for that. I can share, possibly get others' ideas, and try out different options when I needed to change things up. I have a few examples now. I'll have to add more as I find the time and items to save for later.
