[Dan Carroll's Github Pages](https://dan-carroll.github.io/)
-------------------------
These pages are the gateway into Dan Carroll's online world. Included are my GitHub activities as well as work on other sites. This site is created and maintained with Jekyll: <https://jekyllrb.com/>.

## About Me

- [https://github.com/dan-carroll](https://github.com/dan-carroll)

   > My GitHub profile page.

- [https://github.com/dan-carroll/dan-carroll.github.io](https://github.com/dan-carroll/dan-carroll.github.io)

   > This is the repository housing this README file. I am attempting to bring all of my online activities to one place. So these lists are part of that effort. This repository contains the code for my homepage at [Dan Carroll's Github Pages](https://dan-carroll.github.io/).

- [dan-carroll-bio](https://github.com/dan-carroll/dan-carroll-bio)

   > My personal Bio. It is on the menu and linked to in [My GitHub Pages homepage](https://dan-carroll.github.io/). The original repository is at [chuckgroom/onepage-bio](https://github.com/chuckgroom/onepage-bio).

- [dan-carroll-portfolio](https://github.com/dan-carroll/dan-carroll-portfolio)

   > My portfolio which is also accessible from my [homepage](https://dan-carroll.github.io/).

## My Blogs -- and Other Sites

- [Dan Reads](https://dan-carroll.github.io/danreads/)

   > My reading list. And other books I like. Plus books I might recommend. Even thinking about adding kids books since I am the proud Papa (grandpa) of 9.

- [365 Day Graphic Design Challenge](https://dan-carroll.github.io/graphic-design-challenge/)

   > The results of my own personal challenge to learn how, or just do, a new graphic each day for 365 days. Not necessarily all contiguous days as I do tend to become side-tracked at times by other projects.

- [My Python Pages](https://dancarroll.pythonanywhere.com/)

   > My site for much of my meandering journey in learning, and sharing, my work in the programming language of the moment -- Python.

- [Rather Be Coding](#) ![star icon](/assets/img/star.png | width=16)

   > My blog about programming. Details and the blog itself is coming (back). Temporarily offline at the moment.

## My GitHub Projects

   > These may not be original works of mine. Could be forkings of interesting projects I wanted to play around with. Or could be projects created from some of the lessons in the GitHub Lab. This is an attempt to organize things a bit here on GitHub.

- [https://github.com/dan-carroll/dan-carroll](https://github.com/dan-carroll/dan-carroll)
   > The README file here is tied to [my GitHub profile page](https://github.com/dan-carroll) and shows up there.

- [Collection of Development Books Available to Read Online](https://dan-carroll.github.io/online-development-books/)

   > The title above says it all. Follow this link to the GitHub project itself: [https://github.com/dan-carroll/online-development-books](https://github.com/dan-carroll/online-development-books).

- [jQuery Fundamentals](https://dan-carroll.github.io/jquery-fundamentals/) by Rebecca Murphey

   > The original book and derivatives are available here along with my revised (in the works) edition, which is meant to bring Rebecca Murphey's original work up to date. jQuery version 3.7 is the current version with 4.0 to be released soon. The project repository is here: [https://github.com/dan-carroll/jquery-fundamentals](https://github.com/dan-carroll/jquery-fundamentals).

- [PWA Examples](https://dan-carroll.github.io/pwa-examples/)

   > Examples of PWAs. Some are mine. Some are shared from other sites or tutorials. Some are derivatives of others' work. Just a sampling of what is possible and place to possibly start your own.  
   > [This project's GitHub repository](https://github.com/dan-carroll/pwa-examples)

- [html-games](https://github.com/dan-carroll/html-games)

   > HTML, or Javascript, games to increase web app programming skills. And to have fun. Have more to do with this and need to create an index.html file for web access.

- [simple-scaffold](https://github.com/dan-carroll/simple-scaffold)

   > Project to create scaffolding, or possibly a template, to wrap around README files for presentation on the web.

- [python-bottle-snippets](https://dan-carroll.github.io/python-bottle-snippets/)

   > Collection of code snippets for the bottle web framework. And a list of bottle-python tutorials. Plus list of other bottle-python projects on GitHub.  
   > [This project's GitHub repository](https://github.com/dan-carroll/python-bottle-snippets)

- [Python Projects](https://dan-carroll.github.io/python-projects/)

   > Python projects from books, tutorials, and my own creativity.  
   > [This project's GitHub repository](https://github.com/dan-carroll/python-projects)

- [browser-navigation-examples](https://dan-carroll.github.io/navigation-examples/)

   > Test and showcase differing current methods of browser navigation.  
   > [This project's GitHub repository](https://github.com/dan-carroll/navigation-examples)

## Forks Without Changes

> Interesting projects that I have yet to make use of.

- [dan-carroll/pwa-starter](https://github.com/dan-carroll/pwa-starter)

   > Forked from [pwa-builder/pwa-starter](https://github.com/pwa-builder/pwa-starter). Thought I might want to make some changes to this app to suit me. So far, haven't really used it. So, no need to make any changes.  
   > This repo fork may never be changed, or used, and will be removed.

- [dan-carroll/learn.jquery.com](https://github.com/dan-carroll/learn.jquery.com)

   > Forked from [jquery/learn.jquery.com](https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com). Not sure this site is up to date. The README file was updated a few months ago. But the repository files are 7 years old or older. Need to check out the website, [learn.jquery.com](https://learn.jquery.com/), to see if this is even close to being up to date.

## Not Ready for Prime Time

> Project ideas that have yet to get off the ground (not started yet).

- [pool-demo](https://github.com/dan-carroll/pool-demo)

   > This pool demo is meant to be proof of concept type of project. It has a long way to go to be a viable demo. Other projects have taken precedence.  
   > [This project's GitHub repository](https://github.com/dan-carroll/pool-demo)

- [Your GitHub Learning Lab Repository for GitHub Pages](https://dan-carroll.github.io/github-pages-with-jekyll/)

   > [Repository for GitHub Learning Lab course](https://github.com/dan-carroll/github-pages-with-jekyll)
