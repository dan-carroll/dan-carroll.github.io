Now this tutorial, [Building a Mobile App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript](https://blog.openreplay.com/building-a-mobile-app-using-html-css-and-js) by [Wisdom Ekpotu](https://github.com/wisdomekpotu), was great fun. I ended up with a useable app that has become part of my daily routine. See if you can detect the changes I made in the code for a slight [custom fit](https://github.com/dan-carroll/pwa-examples/tree/main/todo-pwa) compared to [the original](https://github.com/wisdomekpotu/PWA-TodoApp).

That is the great thing about open source software, being able to take a look under the hood and make changes to suit yourself. I see myself using this app as a template for others. I should change the theme up for something more custom, but I actually like the look and feel. Kudos to you Mister Ekpotu.

This is a simple app. No complexity. Add to the list and remove items when completed. It is a great little Progressive Web App. And can be extended as far as you would like to take it.

I enjoy it's simplicity. It also does not require access to the website once installed. No web data. It is all self-contained and works great whether you have a live internet connection or not. It simply works.
