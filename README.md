These pages are the gateway into Dan Carroll's online world. Included are my GitHub activities as well as work on other sites. This site is created and maintained with Jekyll: <https://jekyllrb.com/>.

## About Me

- [https://github.com/dan-carroll/dan-carroll.github.io](https://github.com/dan-carroll/dan-carroll.github.io)

   > This is the repository housing this README file. I am attempting to bring all of my online activities to one place. So these lists are part of that effort. This repository contains the code for my homepage at [Dan Carroll's Github Pages](https://dan-carroll.github.io/).

- [dan-carroll-bio](https://github.com/dan-carroll/dan-carroll-bio)

   > My personal Bio. It is on the menu and linked to in [My GitHub Pages homepage](https://dan-carroll.github.io/). The original repository is at [chuckgroom/onepage-bio](https://github.com/chuckgroom/onepage-bio).

## My Blogs -- and Other Sites

- [Dan Reads](https://dan-carroll.github.io/danreads/)

   > My reading list. And other books I like. Plus books I might recommend. Even thinking about adding kids books since I am the proud Papa (grandpa) of 9.

- [365 Day Graphic Design Challenge](https://dan-carroll.github.io/graphic-design-challenge/)

   > The results of my own personal challenge to learn how, or just do, a new graphic each day for 365 days. Not necessarily all contiguous days as I do tend to become side-tracked at times by other projects.

- [My Python Pages](https://dancarroll.pythonanywhere.com/)

   > My site for much of my meandering journey in learning, and sharing, my work in the programming language of the moment -- Python.

- [Rather Be Coding](#)

   > My blog about programming. Details and the blog itself is coming (back). Temporarily offline at the moment.

## My GitHub Projects

   > These may not be original works of mine. Could be forkings of interesting projects I wanted to play around with. Or could be projects created from some of the lessons in the GitHub Lab. This is an attempt to organize things a bit here on GitHub.

- [https://github.com/dan-carroll/dan-carroll](https://github.com/dan-carroll/dan-carroll)
   > The README file here is tied to [my GitHub profile page](https://github.com/dan-carroll) and shows up there.

- [Collection of Development Books Available to Read Online](https://dan-carroll.github.io/online-development-books/)

   > The title above says it all. Follow this link to the GitHub project itself: [https://github.com/dan-carroll/online-development-books](https://github.com/dan-carroll/online-development-books).
